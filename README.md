# rdbms-from-scratch - ToyDB
Welcome to ToyDB! This is an educational project to build a simple, persistent, single-table database from the ground up in C++. The goal is to demystify how databases work by implementing the core components, starting with the storage engine.

This project is inspired by and follows the excellent tutorial at cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/.

üåü Current Features
Persistent Storage: All data is saved to a binary file and reloaded on startup.

REPL Interface: A simple Read-Eval-Print-Loop for interacting with the database.

B-Tree for Indexing: Data is stored and indexed in a B-Tree structure, allowing for efficient lookups. The tree currently supports:

Splitting the root node.

Splitting leaf nodes and updating the parent internal node.

Splitting internal nodes recursively up to the root.

Basic Operations:

insert <id> <username> <email>

select (scans the entire table)

Meta-Commands:

.exit: To exit the application and save the database file.

.constants: To print internal layout constants.

.btree: To print a visualization of the B-Tree structure.

üõ†Ô∏è Building the Database
Prerequisites
To build and run this project, you will need a C++ compiler (g++) and the make utility.

On Debian/Ubuntu Linux:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential

On Windows:
You can use MinGW-w64 through MSYS2 or another distribution. Ensure that g++ and make are in your system's PATH.

Compilation
Once you have the prerequisites, simply run make in the project's root directory:

make

This will compile all the source files and create an executable named db (or db.exe on Windows).

To clean up the build files, you can run:

make clean

This command removes the executable and all intermediate object files.

üöÄ Running and Usage
To start the database, provide a filename as an argument. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

./db mydatabase.db

This will open the REPL interface:

db >

Supported Commands
You can now issue SQL-like commands or meta-commands.

Insert a row:
The table has a fixed schema of (id, username, email). id is the primary key.

db > insert 1 user1 user1@example.com
Executed.
db > insert 2 user2 user2@example.com
Executed.

Select all rows:
This command scans the table and prints all rows.

db > select
(1, user1, user1@example.com)
(2, user2, user2@example.com)

Visualize the B-Tree:
The .btree command prints a representation of the tree structure, which is useful for debugging.

db > .btree
Tree:
- internal (size 1)
  - leaf (size 6)
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
    - 4
    - 5
    - 6
  - key 6
  - leaf (size 7)
    - 7
    - 8
    - 9
    - 10
    - 11
    - 12
    - 13

Exit the database:
This will save all changes to the database file and exit the program.

db > .exit
Bye!

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The database is designed with a modular architecture, separating different concerns into their own files.

main.cpp: Contains the REPL and handles parsing user input.

pager.cpp / pager.h: The Pager is responsible for reading and writing pages of data (fixed at 4KB) from the database file to memory. It maintains an in-memory cache of pages.

table.cpp / table.h: Defines the Table and Cursor structures, which provide a high-level API for interacting with the data.

btree.cpp / btree.h: The heart of the storage engine. This contains all the logic for the B-Tree data structure, including node layout definitions, searching, insertion, and splitting nodes.

Node Layout: Nodes can be NODE_INTERNAL or NODE_LEAF. Each node has a common header containing its type, root status, and a pointer to its parent page.

Internal Nodes store keys and pointers to child pages.

Leaf Nodes store keys and the actual row data (values).

row.cpp / row.h: Defines the Row structure and contains the serialization/deserialization logic to convert a Row to and from its compact binary representation for storage.

üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap
This project is a work in progress. The next major milestones are:

Implementing Deletes: Add support for a delete command, which will involve removing key/value pairs and potentially merging or rebalancing nodes.

B+ Tree Conversion: Evolve the B-Tree into a B+ Tree by adding sibling pointers to all leaf nodes. This will make full table scans much more efficient.

SQL Compiler: Implement a proper SQL front-end with a parser (using Flex/Bison) and a query planner.

Transaction Management: Add ACID compliance through a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for durability and concurrency control mechanisms like MVCC.
